**Background**

The background of this project is to explore the online vacation rentals market by using the dataset from “insideairbnb”. 

Our main motivation for this project is to investigate the housing bubble of Sydney and its effect on both availability and pricing. Additionally the dataset extracted from airbnb will allow us to understand the overall happiness through reviews and to conclude whether the listings are worth the price. 

In order to show the effects of the housing bubble we have included the cities Melbourne and Sydney as both have similar populations and both are considered ideal tourist destinations and the most ideal/popular locations for both cities can be identified. We begin our assessment by comparing and contrasting these various characteristics of the dataset between the cities Sydney and Melbourne. 

**Instruction to clone:**
